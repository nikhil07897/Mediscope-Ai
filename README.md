## Overview

MedScope AI is an innovative, full-stack AI-powered web application designed to bridge the communication gap between patients and healthcare providers. It addresses the challenge of complex medical images (e.g., brain MRIs, chest X-rays, CT scans) and diagnostic reports by providing easy-to-understand, plain-language explanations, pseudo-3D visualizations, and interactive insights. 

The platform empowers patients with instant AI-generated summaries and aids professionals in triage and workflow efficiency. Key innovations include multimodal AI interpretation, 2D-to-3D scan reconstruction, multilingual support, an AI chatbot for queries, and automated PDF report generation/parsing.

Built for the IEEE TechSangam 2025 hackathon (Theme: Healthcare, Domain: Healthcare, PS Category: Software) by Team **Pragati** at MIT-ADT University.

### Problem It Solves
- **Patient Confusion & Anxiety**: Technical medical data is hard for non-experts to interpret, leading to poor decisions.
- **Provider Overload**: Doctors lack time to simplify reports for every patient.
- **Accessibility Gaps**: Especially in rural/underserved areas with limited specialist access.

### Core Value Proposition
One platform to analyze medical data and empower patientsâ€”delivering secure, smart insights from scans and reports.

## Features

### Patient-Facing
- **Upload & Analyze**: Securely upload MRIs, X-rays, CT scans, or diagnosis PDFs.

- **Plain-Language Summaries**: AI-generated reports highlighting abnormalities, in simple English (downloadable PDFs).
- **Multilingual Support**: Translations for global accessibility.
- **AI Chatbot**: Interactive Q&A on diagnoses, symptoms, or reports.
- **Expert Matching**: Connect with relevant medical specialists for consultations (future integration).

### Provider-Facing
- **Triage Tools**: Initial analysis, abnormality detection, and prioritization.
- **Workflow Efficiency**: Reduces diagnostic delays with automated insights.
- **Feedback Loop**: Doctor annotations and report sharing.

### Innovation Highlights
- **Multimodal AI Interpretation**: Combines image segmentation, depth estimation, and NLP for comprehensive analysis.
- **2D-to-3D Reconstruction**: Generates interactive 3D models from 2D inputs.
- **Automated Report Generation**: Custom PDF summaries with confidence scores and disclaimers.
- **Privacy-First**: Anonymized, encrypted data handling; modular design for scalability.

- **PostgreSQL** for secure data storage (user profiles, anonymized scans, reports).

### AI/ML
- **PyTorch/TensorFlow** for core models.
- **OpenCV** for image preprocessing.
- **MiDaS/DenseDepth** for depth estimation (2D-to-3D conversion).
- **U-Net/nnU-Net** for medical image segmentation (e.g., MRI abnormality detection).
- **PDF Parsers**: PyMuPDF/PDFPlumber for report extraction.
- **NLP Tools**: For plain-language summaries and multilingual translation (e.g., Hugging Face models).
- **AI Chatbot**: Integrated via LangChain or similar for conversational insights.

### Infrastructure
- **Cloud Storage**: AWS/Hugging Face for GPU-accelerated processing.

## Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v18+)
- Python 3.10+
- PostgreSQL 13+
- Git

### Quick Start
1. **Clone the Repo**:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/medscope-ai.git
   cd medscope-ai
   ```

2. **Frontend Setup**:
   ```
   cd frontend
   npm install
   npm run dev  # Runs on http://localhost:3000
   ```

3. **Backend Setup**:
   ```
   cd backend
   pip install -r requirements.txt  # Includes PyTorch, TensorFlow, OpenCV, etc.
   cp .env.example .env  # Add DB creds, API keys
   python manage.py migrate  # For Django/Next.js setup
   python manage.py runserver  # Runs on http://localhost:8000
   ```

4. **Database**:
   - Create a PostgreSQL DB: `createdb medscope_db`
   - Update `.env` with connection strings.

5. **AI Models**:
   - Pre-trained models (U-Net, MiDaS) auto-download on first run.
   - For GPU: Ensure CUDA setup; fallback to CPU/Colab for dev.

6. **Run the App**:
   - Access via `http://localhost:3000`.
   - Test uploads with sample DICOM/PDF files (included in `/samples`).

### Environment Variables
| Key | Description | Example |
|-----|-------------|---------|
| `DATABASE_URL` | Postgres connection | `postgresql://user:pass@localhost/medscope_db` |
| `SECRET_KEY` | App secret | `your-secret-key` |
| `AWS_ACCESS_KEY` | Cloud storage (optional) | `your-aws-key` |
| `HUGGINGFACE_TOKEN` | For model downloads | `hf_your_token` |

## Usage

1. **Register/Login**: Patients create accounts for secure access.
2. **Upload Data**:
   - Drag-and-drop scans (DICOM/JPG) or PDFs.
   - App processes: Segments abnormalities â†’ Estimates depth â†’ Generates 3D model â†’ Creates summary.
3. **View Insights**:
   - Interactive 3D viewer (rotate/zoom).
   - Chatbot: "Explain this MRI in Hindi."
   - Download PDF report with disclaimers.
4. **Expert Flow**: Submit for doctor review; receive feedback.
5. **Demo Mode**: Use `/samples` for simulated data (no real uploads needed).

**Example Workflow**:
```
Upload MRI â†’ AI Segments Tumor â†’ 2D-to-3D Render â†’ Generate Summary: "A small lesion detected in the left hemisphereâ€”non-cancerous, monitor recommended." â†’ Chat: "What does this mean?" â†’ PDF Export.
```

## Challenges & Mitigations
